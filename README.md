## Note Blocks

If you clone this repo you should run a:

```bash
npm install
```

After that you must create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Than you can run the project with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For more guidance (like configuring database, etc) you can check [this article](https://dev.to/shiwaforce/notion-like-text-editor-with-ai-autocomplete-and-planetscale-database-in-nextjs-using-shadcnui-4236) for the repo.
In there I will guide you through the whole project creation process step by step.
